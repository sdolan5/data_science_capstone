These files comprise a Shiny app created as the Capstone Project for the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization offered online through Coursera.
The application predicts the next word the user will type by using ngram frequency tables and an algorithm which considers the highest level 
ngram the user's input allows, then "backs off" to lower levels until a prediction can be found.
